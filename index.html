          The Coca-Cola® Freestyle is a touch screen soda fountain which enables
          users to dispense ice cubes and Coca-Cola drink products, allowing
          users to pour and mix a variety of drinks with ease. Users can access
          the features of this interface via touch or a mobile device.

        <h2>Key Observations</h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 darkBlue">
          All observed users instinctively reached for the touchscreen without
          hesitation and did not use a mobile device for drink selection.
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 lightBlue">
          Users who hesitated the most seemed to struggle with selecting a drink
          category or using the touchscreen, with some tapping multiple times
          before the screen registered their input.
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 darkBlue">
          Users seemed to understand where to place their cup and which areas of
          the touchscreen to tap, although some exhibited hesitation when
          deciding whether to tap the button once or press the button and hold.
        </h2>

        <br />
        <h2>User Interview Responses</h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 darkBlue">
          1. Why did you use the Coca-Cola® Freestyle? Did the Coca-Cola®
          Freestyle meet your expectations?
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 textRight lightBlue">
          Users primarily used the machine for customization and variety. Most
          said it met their expectations, though one mentioned the interface was
          slightly confusing at first.
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 darkBlue">
          2. Have you used the Coca-Cola® Freestyle before?
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 textRight lightBlue">
          All three of the interviewed users had used this interface at least
          once before and identified themselves as 'familiar' with how to use
          it.
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 darkBlue">
          3. How do you find the Coca-Cola® Freestyle to use?
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 textRight lightBlue">
          All users found it intuitive, but two noted that the touchscreen was
          only ocasionally responsive. One user noted that the categories
          available were lacking as well as that their drink of choice was
          disabled on the menu.
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 darkBlue">
          4. What stands out to you about the Coca-Cola® Freestyle compared to
          other means of pouring a drink?
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 textRight lightBlue">
          Users highlighted the number of options, recognizing that other soda
          machines they had encountered had either less or more drinks. One user
          noted that the ice cubes did not always dispense.
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 darkBlue">
          5. How do you feel about those differences? Do they add to or take
          away from your experience?
        </h2>
        <br />
        <h2 class="smallerh2 textRight lightBlue">
          Users felt the number of options enhanced their experience when the
          options were not disabled. One user mentioned that the inability to
          dispense ice could be frustrating. Another user noted that, while the
          variety was fun, it could be overwhelming at times.

            This persona is a time-conscious student overwhelmed by the number
            of choices offered by the Coca-Cola® Freestyle. <br />
            <br />She experiences interface problems because the large variety
            of drink options can be overwhelming, the touchscreen is sometimes
            unresponsive and others make accidental selections. <br />
            <br />She reflects the users observed who were visibly frustrated
            when using the machine. They gave off the impression of being
            pressed for time and found the many customization options to be more
            of a challenge than a benefit. <br />
            <br />The design of the Coca-Cola® Freestyle, which encourages
            exploration, may not suit users who want a quick, efficient
            experience.

            This persona is a student excited about experimenting with unique
            drink combinations, eager to try new flavors but frustrated by slow
            touchscreen responsiveness. <br />
            <br />He experiences interface problems because the touchscreen can
            be slow to respond and some options are disabled, disrupting the fun
            of choosing different flavors. <br />
            <br />
            This persona represents users who were enthusiastic about exploring
            flavor combinations. They enjoyed the machine’s customization but
            also encountered usability frustrations, particularly with the
            touchscreen responsiveness.
